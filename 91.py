#create tuple with one item

#to create a tuple with only one item,
# you have to add a comma after the item,
# otherwise python will not recognize it as a tuple.

#one item tuple, remeber the comma:

thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple)

#Not a tuple

thistuple1 = ("mango")
print(type(thistuple1)
